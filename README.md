  <p><strong>Competency Learning Analytics for Insights and Reflection in Education</strong></p>
</div>

## Overview
CLAIRE is a dashboard designed to make learning data more accessible and insightful. Developed as a proof of concept (PoC) in collaboration with **KU Leuven**, **GITO Overijse**, and **Eummena**, it aims to support secondary school teachers in monitoring and interpreting student progress.

This project was initiated by Jonas Van Hove as part of his masterâ€™s thesis, _"Turning Learning Data into Meaningful Learning Analytics Dashboards"_ (2025). The dashboard was further developed in cooperation with Eummena to enhance its functionality and impact.

With great care, the CLAIRE dashboard has been crafted to serve as a valuable tool for future learning analytics dashboards, both within GITO and beyond.

## Project Overview

This prototype demonstrates a Learning Analytics Dashboard designed to support secondary school teachers in interpreting student progress during class councils.

### Key Features:
- **Student Selection & Notes** â€“ Easily filter and select students, view profiles, and check teacher notes.
- **Competency Overview** â€“ Track overall progress, achievements, and status across three semesters.
- **Subject Breakdown** â€“ Visualize class distribution, achieved competencies, and evaluation activities.
- **Competency Details** â€“ Identify competencies that need extra attention and see related evaluations.
- **Activity Insights** â€“ Analyze test scores, assignments, and how students perform compared to their peers.

The dashboard aims to transform raw learning data into clear, actionable insights that enable teachers to make informed decisions during class councils.
